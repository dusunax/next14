## Overview

1. Referenced the following two tutorials & the official documentation for React, Next.js, and Jest

- Next.js 14: https://nomadcoders.co/nextjs-for-beginners/
- Server-side action, Infinite Scroll: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKZAXFjxlJI

2. Feel that Next.js is a good framework.
3. Currently learning **how to test react app** with Jest on Next.js.
4. Want to use Framer Motion stylishly.
5. Happy to have found a good movie API [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-popular-list)
6. Feels like getting too used to Tailwind => so going back to basic CSS this time and use CSS Module.
